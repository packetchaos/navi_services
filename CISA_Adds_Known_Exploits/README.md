# CISA Known Exploits Recently Released - A docker Service

This project is a Proof of Concept to show how you can use the Tenable API and a SQLite DB to solve some powerful use cases.  
Wrapping a simple python script into a docker container makes it easy to deploy and reduces deployment risks.  
It also means you don't need to be a developer or a scripter to take advantage of its power.


# How it works

We are weaponizing navi for good! This python script utilizes navi to tag assets based on "Plugin IDs" and text found in the output of a plugin.  
Navi utilizes a SQLite database to store vulnerability and asset data coming from the export APIs in Tenable.io.


# What does it do?

The script uses the built in tag functionality to tag each asset by CVEs.

Navi uses a SQLite database and the Tenable.io tag assignments endpoint to accomplish everything below.  To make these dynamic, put the container command or the script on a cronjob or scheduled task.

CISA has added five new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.

The script/service tags assets with the below characteristics:

* CVE-2021-27876 Veritas Backup Exec Agent File Access Vulnerability
* CVE-2021-27877 Veritas Backup Exec Agent Improper Authentication Vulnerability
* CVE-2021-27878 Veritas Backup Exec Agent Command Execution Vulnerability
* CVE-2019-1388 Microsoft Windows Certificate Dialog Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
* CVE-2023-26083 Arm Mali GPU Kernel Driver Information Disclosure Vulnerability

### Tag structure

Assets will be tagged with the category "CISA Known Exploits" and the Value "Released April 7th {CVE ID}"
