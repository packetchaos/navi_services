# Security End of Life - A docker Service

This project is a Proof of Concept to show how you can use the Tenable API and a SQLite DB to solve some powerful use cases.  
Wrapping a simple python script into a docker container makes it easy to deploy and reduces deployment risks.  
It also means you don't need to be a developer or a scripter to take advantage of its power.

# Docker command
